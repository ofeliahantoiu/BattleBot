## Overview

The Physical Maze Robot Project is a robotics project aimed at creating an autonomous robot capable of navigating through a maze. The robot is equipped with various sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- *User Interface:* The user interface allows interaction with the robot through buttons and provides basic control.

- *System (Arduino Code):* The core logic of the robot is implemented in Arduino code. It includes modules for actuation, sensor integration, and decision-making. Run the code in Arduino IDE. Select the proper COM port in order to upload code through a wire.

## Getting Started

To replicate or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ofeliahantoiu/BattleBot.git
